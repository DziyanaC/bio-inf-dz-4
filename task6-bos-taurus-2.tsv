5	TEKT1	9913.ENSBTAP00000009779	TEKT1	Tektin-1; Structural component of ciliary and flagellar microtubules. Forms filamentous polymers in the walls of ciliary and flagellar microtubules (By similarity)
8	SPAG7	9913.ENSBTAP00000011329	SPAG7	Sperm-associated antigen 7; Bos taurus sperm associated antigen 7 (SPAG7), mRNA
9	ELP5	9913.ENSBTAP00000025904	ELP5	Elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 5
13	MAPK7	9913.ENSBTAP00000001347	MAPK7	Mitogen-activated protein kinase 7; Plays a role in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell survival. The upstream activator of MAPK7 is the MAPK kinase MAP2K5. Upon activation, it translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates various downstream targets including MEF2C. EGF activates MAPK7 through a Ras- independent and MAP2K5-dependent pathway. May have a role in muscle cell differentiation. May be important for endothelial function and maintenance of blood vessel integrity. MAP2K5 and MAPK7 interact specifically with one another and not with MEK1/E [...]
